            <h1 id="1">Emboding the spirit of a Student Professional</h1>
            <h2>Average Student > <b>Student Professional</b> > Graduate<br>A Student Professional is a student transitioning into being a skilled, polished professional, but not ready for full-time hire. As a Student Professional, Open Campus provides you with the opportunity to gain “real world” experience, build a portfolio, and network with important people in your community.</h2>

            <h1 id="2">What is #thewaywework?</h1>
            <h2>Besides our instagram and twitter hashtag, it's literally the way we work.  Short term, goal oriented projects where we have creative autonomy and the space to use it.  We get it, students are busy but you need some extra money.  As an Open Campus Student Professional, freelancing is done your way -- as gigs: (1 day-1 week), sprints: (1 week-1 month), projects (1 month+), and you negotiate terms of work. Open Campus allows a motivated and talented student the opportunity to get your foot in the door early, make connections in your local business community, earn some extra cash, and gain experience.  You have skills, people have needs, sign up and start working.</h2>

            <h1 id="3">How does a Student Professional "work"?</h1>
            <h2>
            As a Student Professional and a freelancer, you are not only representing yourself, but also the Open Campus community. A Student Professional you should:<br>
            <br>- Introduce yourself as a Student Professional from Open Campus (with a handshake and a smile). 
            <br>- Respect the time of the professional for whom you are working by being sensitive to an employer's schedule and by producing high quality work at a reasonable pace.
            <br>- Be on time and prepared for meetings.
            <br>- Dress on the conservative side if you are unsure about what to wear. 
            <br>- Be yourself!  Businesses LOVE working with students because of the fresh perspective, high energy, and creative thought we bring to the table.
            </h2>

            <h1 id="4">When it comes to payment, just be honest.</h1>
            <h2>Be upfront about money. Negotiate if the payment range is open, and ask how an employer plans to pay you (i.e. cash, check, or other online payment services like Google Wallet.) For longer sprints or projects, set up a payment plan and benchmarks for the job so that you and your employer are on the same page.</h2>

            <h1 id="5">Remember what your mom said about meeting strangers (it applies in the work world too). </h1>
            <h2>Freelancing inherently comes with some risk, and so we expect Student Professionals to follow some simple, common sense guidelines to have an optimal experience.<br><br>
            -Check if the organization you are working for has a website or social media sites. If possible, look up the person you will be working with on LinkedIn, their personal website or their company website.
            <br>- If you’re meeting in a office, research the office before you arrive. If the person you are working for doesn’t have an office, ask to meet in a public place like a coffee shop or a local gathering space.
            <br>- Don’t front money or pay any out of pocket expenses for the job you are working on. 
            </h2>
