We would like a graphic designer that is fluent in web design software to help flesh out concepts for a new website design. Concepts have been developed but need further development and implementation. The website structure itself is simple, there are no complicated features such as e-commerce or DB interaction or many levels of depth.  It is purely a marketing tool meant to address the Saratoga Spring Water lifestyle and story.  We are looking for a highly graphic and contemporary website that features precise and targeted information regarding our brand.”</div>
