        <div class="long-description">“Hi, it's Marcella.  I'm playing around with some ideas for a new feature of Open Campus... it's top secret.  I need a set of "the evolution of a tree" icons.  The first one should start as a seed and then the last should be a blossoming tree.  They should look sleek, professional, edgy but with an artistic/bohemian flare.  Stay away from cartoons.  For this gig, I just need sketches (digital or on paper, no preferance).  If I really like someone's ideas, I will employ them for more money to grow the concept and create more elaborate designs.  Please apply by attaching your portfolio, a few sketches of ideas, nothing serious, but something that can give me an idea of your style.</div>
