          <div class="long-description">“Hi, Marcella here, co-founder and CTO at Open Campus.  I've done all the development for Open Campus and I need some help!  Currently, it's just myself and a RPI user experience engineer Bridget working on the website, but it's time to expand the tech team, since we are, well a web-based company.  I'm looking for a savvy back end developer to JOIN THE TEAM.  We work out of our advisor's luxury office space in Saratoga with free coffee and fruit.  Everyone @ Open Campus is works super hard, we all have our little quarks (i.e., I founded a circle club @ Skidmore), and we're all mentally and physically active superstars.  We like craft beer, food that feeds the mind, body, and soul, and working late at night.  Must attend a school in the Capital Region and be willing to dedicate 10-20 hours a week for the summer.  If the summer goes well, we'll want you to keep working with us throughout the school year & beyond.  Skills needed: I don't have a database set up yet (ek!) so expertise with back-end technologies like the MEAN stack, mySQL, and PHP is a must.  Also we use git, but that's a given.  This is not a QA internship, this is a chance to join a Start Up as the lead back end developer.  You'll even get businesses card.”</div>
