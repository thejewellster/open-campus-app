          <div class="long-description">“Hi my name is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimolsen1/">Jim Olsen</a> and I am the President of Imagination Ink. We are creating a start up that applies digital technology (e.g. variable data personalization, digital watermarks, interactive print, and augmented reality) to the art world in a way that hasn't been done before. As a startup, we're looking to economize in every way. This includes bringing together a group of five talented "starving artists" who are willing to invest their sweat equity by producing three pieces of art that will be considered to create a proof of concept for our future sales effort.”</div>
