<h1>Open Campus Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2><b>Introduction.</b>

<p>This is a website owned and operated by Open Campus, LLC (“Open Campus” or “we”).  Open Campus is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information of the people and businesses that use this web site or any of its applications, contents, or features.  </p>

<p>Please read this entire policy.  By using this website, you consent to the collection and use of your information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and agree to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.  It is very important to us that you understand what information we gather and what we do with this information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 31, 2013.  You may contact Open Campus at 815 N. Broadway, Mailbox # 1303 Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 or Team@opencampusjobs.com.  Or you may reach Open Campus via our website. </p> 

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.  Modifications to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this page.  Using the Open Campus website after a modification has been effectuated constitutes your express consent to the revised Privacy Policy then in effect.  You should review this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service periodically for modifications or changes.  The Privacy Policy will explain the type of information we collect, how we use/store it, and how to correct and/or modify your information.</p>

<p><b>Information we collect.</b><br>
Open Campus collects personally identifiable information for the purposes of connecting students and businesses.  Our mission is to provide students with employment opportunities to develop their skills, while providing businesses the opportunity to fulfill their business needs for short and long-term projects.  </p>

<p>When students register for an account on Open Campus, we ask for your full name, school email, class year, a photo, and your zip code.  This information helps us connect students to local projects and internships posted through Open Campus.  We will use your email address to contact you about Open Campus notifications, updates, and to ask for feedback.</p>

<p>Employers that register on Open Campus will be asked to give their email, business name and location, some identifier for the profile such as a picture, as well as a description of the business and any web links to the business—either direct links to a website or an indirect link to social media (i.e. LinkedIn page).  This helps us connect business owners to qualified applicants.</p>

<p>We store all data on our own Open Campus servers, but as the company grows we may need to use a third party to help store your registration information. If we do retain a third party to manage your information we will notify our users.</p>

<p>We may also ask for some demographic information for our own market research purposes.  This will allow us to tailor Open Campus to provide a better user experience.  We may ask for this information when you register for Open Campus or as a part of our updates.</p>

<p>On our website, we use “cookie” technology to collect data about how our users interact with the website.  A cookie is a small file that is stored on your hard drive and is used to help us improve our services.  If you do not want cookies from Open Campus or other websites, you can change the settings in your browser.</p>

<p>We automatically log information about your use of our website.  This data includes information like user’s operating systems, browsers, IP addresses, previously visited webpages, date and time stamps, etc.  This helps us understand which parts of our website are most popular, as well as how we can improve the Open Campus user experience.</p>

<p><b>Who can see your information.</b><br>
Only registered users can see user profiles.  Business owners will only be able to see the student profiles that qualify for the project they posted.  While Open Campus profiles are not public information in the sense that anyone can search your name in a database like GOOGLE and see everything in your profile, you should understand that anything you post on the internet is publically available in varying degrees.  Users should be careful what they post in their profile to protect themselves from internet trolls. You should not put sensitive data on your profile you would not want to be made public such as (i) racial or ethnic origin, (ii) political, philosophical, religious beliefs, (iii) physical or mental health details, (iv) addictions and other personal life habits, (v) the commission of any criminal or unlawful offense, or (vi) identifying information such as a social security number.  If your resume does contain this information, you agree to make the information available at your own risk.  </p>

<p>User email addresses will NOT be posted on Open Campus profiles.  </p>

<p>When student users complete an Open Campus project, that project will be added to the student’s profile so prospective Open Campus employers can see previous Open Campus work history.  </p></p>

<p>If a student qualifies for a particular business project, employers will be able to see those students’ profiles.  This enables employers to reach out to the students through the Open Campus messaging system.  Students may give out their email address through the Open Campus messaging system.  Conversations between users are not publically displayed on the website.  These conversations are stored on our servers until both parties delete the conversation.  </p>

<p>While we take many precautions to protect your information and ensure the security of our network, we cannot guarantee this will prevent third-party hackers from illegally obtaining personal information.  This is true of every internet service, so be aware of this risk when you agree or download any internet product.</p>

<p><b>Using the website.</b><br></p>
Employers may use the website to post employment opportunities through Open Campus.  Employers may also search student profiles posted on Open Campus if a student agrees to release their profile for employer searches.  Students release this information when they register with Open Campus.  

<p>Employers who post through the website are required to comply with all applicable laws of their state, including without limitation equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination laws.  Students must also, at all times, comply with all applicable laws that relate to Open Campus, their use of Open Campus or the information posted therein.</p>

<p><b>Sharing data.</b><br>
With your consent.  We may share or disclose any user’s collected information with that user’s consent and at that user’s discretion.  All users agree to share information with Open Campus and other Open Campus users when they register with the site.  If any user links social media to their Open Campus account, they are also consenting to sharing that information on Open Campus.  By sharing data on Open Campus, that user data may be included in aggregate reports developed for studies and/or similar circumstances.  If you have questions about policies and practices of a specific employer, you should reach out to that employer directly.</p>

<p>Required by law.  User information may be shared with third parties if required by law or the circumstances deem it necessary to disclose to third parties.  This includes supplying information to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>Within Open Campus.  User information may be shared within Open Campus, LLC in order to provide quality services.  </p>

<p><b>Billing and payment. </b><br> 
    Users that pay to post projects through Open Campus must use the third party service “Braintree Payments.”  Users should read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of this service.  Each user agrees to comply with the terms and conditions and privacy policy of Braintree Payments.  Open Campus is not liable for site/transaction issues within that payment service.  All information given to Braintree Payments for payment purposes is subject to the Braintree Payments privacy policy.</p>

<p>Non-personal information.  Non-personal identifying information collected (e.g. age, gender, etc.) may be shared with third parties. </p> 

<p><b>Miscellaneous. </b><br>
 It may become necessary to use your information to provide technical services upon your request to ensure the functionality of website services, as well as provide notice to all users about updates, troubleshooting, bugs, fixes, and general information we think you all should be aware of.</p>

<p>Third-Party Analytics: We use an assortment of third-party providers to help us understand how users interact with our services so that we may improve them. Examples of such services are Mixpanel, Crashlytics, and Google Analytics. To find out more about these services and the data they collect, please visit their websites at: 
<a href="www.crashlytics.com">www.mixpanel.com</a>
<a href="www.mixpanel.com">www.crashlytics.com</a>
<a href="www.google.com/analytics">www.google.com/analytics</a></p>

<p><b>Updating account information.</b><br>
You may change or correct personal information you have provided at any time.  You may do this by going to your profile and clicking “edit” and changing the information that needs to be updated.  Users may update their name, email, college or university, skills, and add/delete completed gigs, sprints and projects completed outside of Open Campus.  All information must follow the Open Campus job template we’ve created for You.</p>

<p><b>User age.</b><br>
Only college students may use Open Campus.  Because not every student begins college at the age of majority, users under 18 years of age may need parental consent to agree to the Open Campus privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>

<p>Open Campus, LLC will comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws.  Therefore, we restrict registration on the Open Campus website to persons 13 years or older.</p>

<p>By accepting this policy you affirm that you:
<ul>
<li>- Are over the age of 18, OR</li>
<li>- Are an emancipated student who has the authority to create binding contracts, OR</li>
<li>- Have parental permission to register and use the services in Open Campus if you are between 13 and 17.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Links to other sites.</b><br>
Open Campus may offer links to other websites.  Those websites have their own privacy policies and you will have to abide by those privacy policies if you go to those webpages.  We encourage you to read those privacy policies as they apply to you.</p>

<p><b>International users.</b><br>
We will abide by the safe harbor framework articulated by the US Department of Commerce regarding collection, retention, and user of personal information collected from the European Union.</p>
