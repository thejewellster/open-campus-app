				<h3>Israeli Startups from Popular Science</h3>
				<a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/why-are-israeli-startups-leading-tech-world"><h2><img src="img/write.png" height="20px" style="padding: 0 5 5 0;"alt="">Why Are Israeli Startups Leading The Tech World?</h2></a>
				
				<div class="blog-post-image">
					<img src="img/idf.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
				</div>
				<h3>Most Important Takeaway</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list">
					<li>When people think of a place where the environment is conducive to tech startups, I would guess, many do not think of Israel. However, they would be mistaken. Israel’s startup scene is booming. The tech start ups that Popular Science mentions are all military and cyber security businesses. Israel’s history of conflict has helped to create a culture where people have an urge to create in ideas that can protect their country, and save lives around the world. </li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Quick Looks</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list-1">
					<li>"The general awareness people here have for risk is always present and this mentality has made its mark on the country's business climate, influencing technological developments. </li>
					<li>"Every one of us is concerned with security." Military life has left an indelible mark on Israel's booming start-up scene, leading the country to the frontlines of the tech ecosystem in odd ways.'"</li>
					<li>“Israel is an environment where "there's zero tolerance for work-arounds," Loven said. Part of what's pushing the country's tech boom, he said, is that "there's a lot of pressure to develop something something that actually works, and not just in lab environments." This provides a primal urgency that headquarters in Silicon Valley strewn with kegs and Ping-Pong tables can lack.'"</li>

 “Even when you find that a product or service already exists, you shouldn't assume that you should stay away from that idea altogether.

					<li>“A World Health Organization official earlier this year declared that 2013 was the worst year that the international community had seen in more than sixty years.”</li>

					<li>“For the first time since World War II, there are more than 50 million people displaced from their homes thanks to war and violence.”</li>
					<li>“Since June, the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) has been pushing across Iraq, causing a mass exodus of civilians in their path to flee for safety. As of last week, the United Nations estimated roughly 1.2 million internally displaced people (IDPs) were seeking shelter in Iraq, with another 300,000 requiring humanitarian assistance. There’s also an additional 200,000 refugees from Syria alone sheltering in Baghdad, also needing aid.”</li>
					<li>“Of a population of 4.5 million, there are currently at least half a million [Internally Displaced People] in the Central African Republic and more than half of all Central Africans in need of assistance.”</li>
					<li>“All signs in South Sudan, according to experts, points towards a pending famine in the young country. “By the end of the year, we’re facing a situation where one out of every two people in South Sudan are either going to have a real threat to their lives because of hunger or they will have been displaced from their homes … or they will have fled from the country”</li>
					<li>“While the aid is starting to flow in now, the fact remains that as of last month the United Nations reported that more than 400,000 Syrians still live in beseiged areas, the vast majority of whom are under assault from government forces.”</li>

Or that wire can make contact anywhere on the body of an attacker touching the computer with a bare hand (sweaty hands work best). The ground signal can also be measured by fastening an alligator clip at the far end of an Ethernet, VGA, or USB cable attached to the computer, or even wirelessly with sensitive voltage-detection equipment. The catch is that contact must be made as data is unlocked with a key—during decryption of a folder or an e-mail message, for instance.”</li>

				<h3>Most Important Takeaway</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list">
					<li>
Google’s self-driving car is programmed to go up to 10 miles per hour above the speed limit. This programming “above the law” elicits many legal questions. Who is responsible when a self-driving car breaks the law? When is it permissible for a car to break the law? These questions have not been answered, but they must be considered before we start commercializing self-driving cars. </li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Quick Looks</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list-1">
					<li> “Research shows that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are going much faster actually can be dangerous … so its autonomous car can go up to 10 mph (16 kph) above the speed limit when traffic conditions warrant.”</li>
					<li>“Perhaps it is safest to speed in excess of 20 miles per hour on St. Patrick’s Day, because going near the speed limit around drunk drivers agitates them and makes them more reckless. We doubt that a law could ever really be flexible enough to know when it should be permissible for Google to speed.”</li>

				<div class="blog-post-image">
					<img src="img/Kill-Switch.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
				</div>
				<h3>Most Important Takeaway</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list">
					<li>Before we applaud California’s new law to secure our phones from theft, in the form of a phone kill-switch, we must look at the potential ramifications of such a law. The kill-switch has the “ability to remotely deactivate the phone.” This can be used when your phone has been stolen or lost. However, it can also be used by unwanted parties for malicious purposes.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Quick Looks</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list-1">
					<li>
“The law raises concerns about how the switch might be used or abused, because it also provides law enforcement with the authority to use the feature to kill phones. And any feature accessible to consumers and law enforcement could be accessible to hackers, who might use it to randomly kill phones for kicks or revenge, or to perpetrators of crimes who might—depending on how the kill switch is implemented—be able to use it to prevent someone from calling for help.”

				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list">
					<li>In the beginning of my sophomore year, I started Skidmore College’s Women in Business Club. The creation of Women in Business took significant time and energy, but in less than one year’s time it has expanded my network and my business knowledge, engaged my passion for working toward women’s’ equality, introduced me to circles in the local community, and even presented opportunities to attend conferences at The Wharton School of Business and Harvard Business School. If you have a passion for something that isn’t represented at your school, whether it’s writing, graphic design, culture, or debate, then start a club! It can open a lot of doors, it is great experience, and it can be an incredibly rewarding endeavor. I’ll provide some steps to start your own club and offer some advice about how to manage and run a club.</li>

					Pick your purpose: What is your club about, what does it focus on, and what is its goal? Choose a name that accurately reflects your purpose. Most likely, you can find a list online of school/student government sponsored clubs, which you can scan for both a general framework for club names and to make sure that your club is differentiated from any similar clubs on campus. Once you’ve chosen a name, write a mission statement and provide a few concrete goals that your club strives to achieve. For example, if you’re starting a computer science club your mission might be to provide a space for computer scientists to collect, discuss, and discover, while a goal might be to sponsor monthly hackathons on campus.
					</li>
					<li>Recruit your team: Find others who share your interest and can get behind the vision for your club. Having official titles such as President, Vice President for Marketing, Vice President for Operations, Vice President for Public Relations, etc. will be crucial when your club delegates responsibility. Choose positions that make sense given your club’s requirements to function on a regular basis. Of course, you can always be a bit creative – Skidmore’s aspiring beekeeping club, for example, has officially titled their leader “Queen Bee.”  In terms of the leadership team that you assemble, don’t just choose friends (in fact it may be better if you don’t). Instead, post on community forums, make posters, or make an announcement on Facebook or Twitter that you are looking for club leaders. Be sure to choose enthusiastic people with diverse skill sets and to assign them to positions that complement their unique talents. As a final step, find one or more faculty advisors who can lend their expertise and professional support to your club.</li>
					<li>Plan: Once you have a group of motivated leaders, you must spend a substantial amount of time together just planning.  Decide as a group how frequently your club will meet, what time, and where. A great tool for scheduling meetings when everyone is on a different schedule is Doddle. Once you’ve picked a time and place, delegate responsibilities such as sending out meeting reminders, making room reservations, and regular setup. Depending on the type of club you are starting, you may need to plan out a few meetings in advance. Decide upfront whether your leaders will create a strict agenda for each meeting or have more informal gatherings. The more norms and expectations that you can set with your leadership team upfront, the better.</li>
					<li>Make it Official: There are two potential ways to make your club official. First, you may be able to register your club as a chapter through a national organization. For example, if you plan on starting a Model United Nations club, you would start your chapter through The United Nation Association. Often times by working with a national organization, your club can gain access to marketing supplies and other resources. You may also be able to have your club officially recognized either by bringing your club to your school administration or through student government. Institutional recognition will help your club by bringing in more students and also attract faculty and alumni who support your club. Being school official may also mean that you can apply for a budget for club activities and events. Don’t forget to thank any chapter coordinators or administrators who help your club along the way. Being courteous to all those who service build your club will encourage their continued support be and may cause them to keep you in mind when opportunities cross their desks.</li>
					<li>Market your club: In order to better establish your presence on campus, your club will require strong marketing. Open Campus maybe just the place to look for talented students to help create your club image with logos, websites, posters, apparel, and more. Hang signs around campus advertising your club’s meetings including the 5 W’s: Who, What, Where, When, and Why. Hold a first event that is true to your mission statement and goals as a kickoff for your club. Contact your school’s newspaper(s), television station, radio station, or other media outlets and ask for some attention. If you’re really serious, contact your school’s communications department and ask to be featured on the school’s website and/or social media sites. Lastly, add your members to an e-mail list to keep them up to date on meetings, events, and club news.</li>
					<li>Get Off Campus: Contact similar clubs at other colleges and universities and attend their events. You may be able receive funding to attend conferences, competitions, or other events off campus. Eventually, you may even be able to host students from other school for events of your own. Either way, networking with people who are as passionate about what you do as you are is an excellent opportunity.</li>

				<h3>Most Important Takeaway</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list">
					<li>Networking requires planning and execution.  Most importantly, it requires an equal amount of talking about yourself and asking them about themself.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Quick Looks</h3>
				<ul class="blog-post-list-1">
					
					<li>Get business cards: It is never too early to get business cards. Even if your card is serving as more of a personal card, offering your business card is much more professional than pulling out your smart (or maybe flip) phone or a piece of scrap paper when someone asks, “How can I contact you?” If you offer even a simple card you will seem professional and put together (and you are more likely to get a call or e-mail).</li>
					<li>Be active: Attend conferences, conventions, workshops, panels, lectures, speeches, galleries, galas, etc. Simply put: Get out there! Attend events at your school and push yourself to meet people. Check event listings in your college or hometown. Attend events through clubs, professional societies, or any other associations you’re affiliated with. Also, don’t neglect your college’s career development office and it’s resources such as alumni events and mentoring networks.</li>
					<li> Research, research, research: If you will be attending any type of event, especially one geared toward networking, do your research. Find a list of keynotes speakers, a guest list, or ask who will be in attendance. You can read biographies provided for the event ahead of time or you can search names on the internet. You may find a Linkedin profile, a bio on a company’s website, or you may even run into galleries, portfolios, blogs/blog posts, or articles by that person. If you knew that the Open Campus Co-Founders were going to be at conference, for example, you might look them up on Linkedin to see what else they’ve done and what are their interests.  This type of information can be used to target a few people that you think would be of value to meet. However, when you do meet them, it is not appropriate to regurgitate that person’s autobiography to them. Instead, use what you’ve learned about them to pitch an idea, project, or goal in a way that strikes a chord with that person.</li>
					<li>Read up (and get a business card): Once you’ve selected a person who you want to be part of your network and have done your research, you may want to dig a little deeper into the field in which they work, especially if you have particular interest in it. Whether the person you have targeted is an artist or a finance professional, chances are they are a busy person. You can start a conversation with “I noticed/heard you say/am interested that you work in (insert field/profession here). Have you read the article about (insert relevant topic here) in (insert reputable source here)?”</li>
					<li>Add your contacts on LinkedIn: Many professionals on LinkedIn require an e-mail address to request them as a connection. Luckily, there is a good chance that the e-mail address on the business card they provided you is the right one. Be sure to request your new contact as a connection soon after meeting them. Since they probably meet people constantly, it may be wise to add a personalized message along with your request that thanks them and subtly reminds them where you met and what you talked about. For example you could write:“It was great meeting you at the computing conference, Brenda. Thank you for your expert advice on what courses to take to learn more about algorithm design – I’m already registered. Below is the link to the article about cloud computing in China that I mentioned during our conversation.” If a contact accepts, he or she is likely to view your profile and some of his or her connections may too. There is a snowball effect to networking, especially online!</li>
					<li>Organize your contacts: Once you’ve become an expert at collecting business cards, you may need a way to organize them. Linkedin is one thing, but a lot of the info on a business card, like a phone number, is not listed on a Linkedin profile. You don’t want to lose a dream job or million dollar deal in the couch cushions, right? You can purchase a business card book that holds close to 100 business cards at most office supply stores and even some drug stores for under $10. I actually bought mine at CVS. A vinyl Rolodex Business Card Book at Office Depot is only $7.50. There are also more expensive, luxurious leather bound books with higher card capacities (which might make a great gift wish for an upcoming birthday or holiday). As a bonus, most business card books have a holder in the front for your own business cards.</li>
					<li>Caffeine: “Let’s get coffee” is the universally accepted way to ask someone to have an informal discussion with you. Send an e-mail or a message on Linkedin asking a person you’ve networked with to get coffee. If they accept, make sure that you let them pick a convenient time for them and be sure to confirm the time and place too. Getting coffee is the perfect time to ask more questions about that person’s life, career, and interests. Most importantly, it’s a time to share what you’re passionate about and to establish ways in which your new contact can help you reach your goals.</li>
					<li>Say “Thank you”: Recently, there has been some debate over whether a handwritten card is necessary or if a simple e-mail note will suffice. I personally believe that a handwritten thank you can never hurt. Who doesn’t like getting a card filled with praise and thanks? Consider going to your school’s’ bookstore to get note cards with your college’s seal or logo on them. Search local bookstores and paper good websites such as Papyrus to find the right style cards – creative or conservative – to suit your needs. Thank-you cards will come in handy when a busy, successful person takes the time to get coffee with you, interview you for a job, or otherwise give you a helping hand.</li>
