It incorporates years of learning about how to handle real-time data on the web and solves many of the hard problems so that developers donâ€™t have to solve them again.  Open Campus integrates Firebase to not only host all of our data, but additionally allow you to <i>see</i> your profiles and job posts updated in real time.  We know that finding talent or finding a job is one of your priorities, so why not create an experience that gives you the feedback you want and deserve.  Thanks to Firebase, we can give you that.</div>
